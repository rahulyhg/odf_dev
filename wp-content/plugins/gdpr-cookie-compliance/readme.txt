### Live Examples

* You can choose to setup our GDPR plugin in any way that you like. 
* We have created the plugin with as much flexibility as possible as organisations interpret the Cookie Consent Policy differently.
* A few examples of how you can setup our plugin in various ways are below:

**OPTION A** 
No cookies are stored on users' computers (not even the Cookie that is required to power our own plugin = we call it Strictly Necessary Cookies) until the user accepts Cookies. 
[Example 1](https://www.mooveagency.com/wordpress-plugins/gdpr-cookie-compliance/)

**OPTION B**  
You can setup our plugin so that Cookies are accepted by default but the user has the option to turn them off. 
[Example 2](https://www.teneo.net/uk/)
[Example 3](https://www.nacro.org.uk/)

**OPTION C**  
You can display the Cookie Consent Banner at the top of the page.
You can also setup the plugin so that cookies are accepted once user scrolls down the page.
[Example 4](https://www.mrisoftware.com/uk/)

There are many other variations organisations choose to set the plugin up, our plugin is very flexible.

### Custom Layout

* You can also create your own custom front-end layout of the Cookie Settings Screen.
* Simply copy the "gdpr-modules" folder from the plugin directory to your theme directory. 
* If you do this, your changes will be retained even if you update the plugin in future. 
* Any customisation should be implemented by experienced developers only.


### Personalised installation & setup 
* Contact us if you'd like a personalised advice, installation or support for bespoke customisations on plugins@mooveagency.com (please note that this is a paid service).
* For general support, please use the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gdpr-cookie-compliance/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is GDPR? = 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European regulation to strengthen and unify the data protection of EU citizens. ([https://www.eugdpr.org/](https://www.eugdpr.org/))

= How do I setup your plugin? =
* You can setup the plugin in the WordPress CMS main menu (on the left-hand side) -> GDPR Cookie Compliance.

You can use the following link to display the Cookie Settings Screen window:

[Relative Path - RECOMMENDED]
/#gdpr_cookie_modal

[Absolute Path]
https://www.example.com/#gdpr_cookie_modal
https://www.example.com/your-internal-page/#gdpr_cookie_modal


= Pasted code is not visible when view-source page is viewed. =
* Our plugin loads the script with Javascript, and that’s why you can’t find it in the view-source page. 
* You can use the developer console in Chrome browser (Inspect Element feature) and find the scripts.

= Can I use custom code or hooks with your plugin? =
* Yes. We have implemented hooks that allow you to implement custom scripts. 
* You can also find list of all pre-defined hooks here: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/conditional-php-script/

= Does the plugin support subdomains? =
* Unfortunately not, subdomains are treated as separate domains by browsers and the plugin is unable to alter cookies stored by another domain. 
* If your multisite setup uses subdomain version, each subsite will be recognised as a separate domain by browsers and will create separate cookies for each subdomain.

= Does this plugin block all cookies? =
No. This plugin only restricts cookies for scripts that you have setup in the Settings. If you want to block all cookies, you have to add all scripts that use cookies into the Settings of this plugin. 

= Once I add scripts to this plugin, should I delete them from the website’s code? =
Yes. Once you setup the plugin, you should delete the scripts you uploaded to the plugin from your website’s code to ensure that your scripts are not loaded twice.

= Does this plugin stop all cookies from being stored? =
This plugin is just a template and needs to be setup by a developer in order to work properly. Once setup fully, it will prevent scripts that store cookies from being loaded on users computers until consent is given.
 
= Does this plugin guarantee that I will comply with GDPR law?=
This plugin is just a template and needs to be setup by a developer in order to work properly.
